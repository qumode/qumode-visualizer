Most computing paradigms in theoretical physics are generally based on diagrams infering a pasrticular phenomenon from quantum gates  to Feynmann diagrams, and category theory are represented graphically.

In quantum computing we find more artifacts of these method, for example tensor diagrams and gates can easily be represented as diagrams and it suffices as a good practice

Quantum Computing has inspired me to think of computation more often diagrammatically. This inspired QUMODE.

Qumode is a repository containing a set of libraries (artifacts) that makes it super easy to build blazing fast & reactive visual programming language for the web.

It offers a core data processing framework and a library with React-components that will get you started. Take a look at the underlying artifacts to learn more about Wire and its offerings.

QUMODE also depends on node packages [Quantum Tensor Networks](https://github.com/stared/quantum-tensors). This is currently under development.

### QUMODE Artifacts

-   [Q-Core](artifacts/wire-core): The core processing framework
-   [Q-UI](artifacts/wire-ui): A React-library with suitable UI components
-   [Q-Editor](artifacts/wire-editor): An example of a visual node editor built with Wire
